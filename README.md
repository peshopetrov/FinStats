This library is already published as an Apps Script, making it easy to include in your project. To add it to your script, do the following in the Apps Script code editor:

1. Click on the menu item "Resources > Libraries..."
2. In the "Find a Library" text box, enter the project key `MjRXDkDWkiieFw0Ii00iIlCgcj5q6Otzs` and click the "Select" button.
3. Choose a version in the dropdown box (usually best to pick the latest version).
4. Click the "Save" button.

Or, you can copy and paste the FinStats.gs file directly into your script project.
